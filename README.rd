ANL - Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis of the Voice
This work presents the theoretical background to provide the phase space reconstruction of chaotic voice signals. The reconstruction of phase space requires the useof thechaos theory and statistical methods such as mutual information and falseneighbors. The reconstruction of the phase space in voice signals provides greater accuracy in the diagnosis of pathologies of the vocal system.
